* read-dataset-mat5 vs read-dataset
* ex6 plotting decision boundaries (can't see how to do it with jlibsvm)
* ex6_spam is very slow (but pretty slow on Octave too)
* ex7: computing the covariance matrix takes forever
* incanter 1.5.1
* ex8 is really slow
* some repetition in :reshape args vs initial parameters for fmincg (maybe always reshape on args by default?)
