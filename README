A reimplementation of the exercises from the Stanford ML course
(https://www.coursera.org/course/ml ),
in order to learn Incanter and explore Machine Learning algorithms.

The layout of this repo is roughly as follows:
* src/ml/ex[n].clj sets up the exercise reading data
  (along the same lines as the original Octave ones)
* test/ml/test-ex[n].clj verifies that the exercise got the results
  expected in the exercise documentation
* other files are library files, shared among the exercises

Prerequisites:
* lein
